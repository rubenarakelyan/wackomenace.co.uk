excerpt: What it means to “JFDI” and why anything else grates so much.

What does it mean to “JFDI”? At its simplest, it is a direct instruction to someone to get on with whatever needs to be done at that moment. Four words - “just fucking do it” - that serve as a call to action, cut through the bureaucratic noise of the workplace and are not always safe for work. Although often uttered in jest or with friendly intentions, it can also be a very direct wake-up call to someone who is spending too much of their time in the morass of red tape, permission-asking or process-checking.

But it is so much more that just a real-time order for action. For me, it’s a whole way of mind.

## But Ruben, how do you work so fast?

I get asked this a lot. In a lot of places I’ve worked at, people seem to not be able to believe that I’m able to get through as much work as I do. Whether that be measured in ticket velocity, responding to colleagues, juggling multiple go-lives with external parties or anything else, it feels like a natural flow state to me but supersonic to everyone else.

For a while, I wondered myself what exactly was happening and what (if anything) I was doing differently to others on my teams. Was it just a perception, something innate within me or some specific difference in my ways of working?

Then, after speaking to some colleagues and multiple rounds of feedback, I worked it out.

## Living and breathing JFDI

It turns out that for some reason, either nature or nurture, my mind is heavily oriented towards both action and speed. Now, I’m sure there are plenty of people in the same boat as me, but maybe not all of them so vocal about it.

For me, JFDI is my only mode of operation and how I live my life generally, whether at work or outside. I naturally gravitate towards analysing problems, coming up with one or more potental solutions, choosing one and then going with it until the end. Note that none of this includes checking processes, asking for permissions or holding back due to hesitation.

Call it “forgiveness rather than permission” if you will.

## Doesn’t this just make you an annoying jerk?

Well, maybe to people whose only or primary role is to enforce processes or permissions. You could class these people as having [Bullshit Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs), since enforcing processes or permissions does not normally have any kind of meaningful, positive impact.

The point is, maybe 90% of the time, following a 20-step process with triplicate forms and a ritual sacrifice followed by 5 levels of permission would not have resulted in anything different from what I did in the first place. It would have only slowed down efforts by days, weeks or sometimes months or scuppered them altogether.

Now, a lot of colleagues might fear the fallout from following this path, or are just not interested enough in their job to want to go faster. I understand that, and this method of working is obviously not for everyone. Luckily for me, to date I haven’t had anyone who has tried to get me in trouble simply to slow me down and not make themselves look slow in comparison. In fact, everyone who has talked to me about it has done so while lamenting that they can’t (or maybe more accurately, won’t) do the same themselves.

## Why do you care so much?

It’s fair to ask why I stick my neck out so much by working in this way, opening up potential challenge or disciplinary action, when I could just put my head down, do what is needed and go home.

Well, reader, I know no other. For me, it’s JFDI or nothing. I simply cannot bring myself to know what needs to be done, have others ask me for it in desperation every day, but not be able to do anything about it because Bob in IT Security Operations hasn’t written up a paper on the pros and cons of making all their code repositories private “just in case” and taken it for a 2 hour discussion at the next “monthly tripartite inter-organisation heads of security touch-base virtual roundtable”.

## What does this mean for me?

I’m not petitioning anyone to drop their entire way of working and take on this mode in the hope of some panacea, but I am trying to explain to the curious the “secret” of my speed. But if it does make even one person sit up and say “to hell with it, action is much more important than endless conversation” then that’ll make me very happy.
