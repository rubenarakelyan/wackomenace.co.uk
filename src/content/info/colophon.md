For the technology-minded, here are some details of how I build, maintain and host this website.

* Built with the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
* Maintained with [Nova](https://nova.app)
* Hosted by [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) via [GitHub](https://github.com/rubenarakelyan/wackomenace.co.uk)
* Logo designed by [Jord Riekwel](https://larkef.com)
