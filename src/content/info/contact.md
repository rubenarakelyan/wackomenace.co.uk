I encourage and welcome all readers (that includes you!) to contact me - if something I wrote about resonates with you, you want to comment on it or disagree with it, then I’m very happy to hear from you.

Please be civil though - angry rants or threats will be unceremoniously deleted without reply. I may also block and/or report senders of such correspondence as I see fit if it’s particularly egregious.

I try to reply to all emails as soon as I can but please allow some time before chasing me up - I do have a day job and family too!

Want to contact me securely? Encrypt your email using [my PGP key](/pgpkey.asc) or get it via:

`gpg --auto-key-locate wkd --locate-keys ruben@arakelyan.uk`
