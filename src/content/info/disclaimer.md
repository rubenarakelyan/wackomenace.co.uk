This is my personal website. The opinions expressed here are my own and not those of any employer or client of mine.

Circumstances change and opinions, beliefs and views have to change with them. What worked yesterday may not work today or tomorrow. All this is to say, what you may read in a years-old blog post may not reflect what I currently think, or the current state of some technology. Take it as a snapshot. Agree or disagree. [Talk to me about it](mailto:ruben@arakelyan.uk) or write your own blog post in reply.

Progress is guaranteed. Openness to change is recommended. Civil discourse and disagreement are encouraged.
