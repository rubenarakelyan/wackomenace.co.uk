    <p><strong role="heading">My full name is <span itemprop="givenName">Ruben</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Arakelyan</span> (<span lang="hy">Ռուբէն Առաքելեան</span> in Armenian).</strong></p>
    <p>The question I am most asked: how do you pronounce your name?</p>
    <p>If you speak English or a similar language, here’s audio of the pronunciation:</p>
    <audio src="/assets/ruben.en.m4a" controls itemscope itemprop="additionalType" itemtype="https://schema.org/PronounceableText">
      <meta itemprop="phoneticText" content="/ɻʊɓən ɑɹɑkelʎɑn/">
      <meta itemprop="inLanguage" content="en-GB">
      <meta itemprop="textValue" content="Ruben Arakelyan">
      <meta itemprop="speechToTextMarkup" content="IPA">
    </audio>
    <p>If you speak Armenian or a similar language, here’s audio of the pronunciation:</p>
    <audio src="/assets/ruben.hy.m4a" controls></audio>
    <p>And if you understand IPA, here’s what I think is the correct rendering:</p>
    <p><strong>ɻʊɓən ɑɹɑkelʎɑn</strong> (<a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz">hear it</a>)</p>
    <p>Any corrections to the above to better match the Armenian pronunciation are welcome.</p>

I was born in [Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon,_London), south London — home of [The Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon) — and lived there for approximately 5 years before moving across the river to [Eastcote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastcote) where I lived, grew up and went to school (where my [year 11 ball](https://web.archive.org/web/20040717231151/http://education.independent.co.uk/news/story.jsp?story=539986) was featured in The Independent).

At the end of 2003, I created my first website, wackomenace (named after I used one of the then common ninja name generator websites), using a prepaid card ([Splash Plastic](https://web.archive.org/web/20031213005651/http://www.splashplastic.com/)) and a friendly web host that accepted it ([Purple Cloud](https://web.archive.org/web/20030210115238/http://www.purplecloud.com/)). It soon grew to include a blog, tools and resources as well as some of my first open source code.

I quickly got into the then popular “blog scene” featuring such luminaries as (in no particular order) [Matt Haughey](https://a.wholelottanothing.org/), [Anil Dash](https://anildash.com/), [Jeffrey Zeldman](https://www.zeldman.com/), [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/), [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/), Mark Pilgrim, Cameron Barrett, [Dave Shea](http://daveshea.com/), [Dan Cederholm](https://simplebits.com/), [Douglas Bowman](https://stopdesign.com/), [Daniel Bogan](https://waferbaby.com/), [Shaun Inman](https://shauninman.com/) and [Cameron Moll](http://cameronmoll.com), amongst others, taking design and development cues as the web quickly evolved. I was one of the [kottke.org micropatrons](https://kottke.org/about/patron/) and Kickstarter backers for the reboot of [Upcoming.org](https://upcoming.org/about/backers).

In 2006, I went to university at the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/) where I got a degree in Computer Science. During that time, I worked for a year at the [Microsoft Technology Centre in Reading](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/about/offices/reading/).

Around the end of 2008, wackomenace went offline as I migrated to more “respectable” domain names.

My first job out of university was a Business Analyst at [Shell](https://www.shell.co.uk/) on the graduate programme. I stayed with Shell for four-and-a-half years, working in a number of areas and it’s also where I met my future wife.

During this time, I also ran TwentyFourNine, a small web development agency, on the side. I was even one of the sponsors of [BarCamp London 9](https://nine.barcamplondon.org/sponsors/).

After this time, I decided that I wanted to get back into hands-on development and so left the comfort of a multinational company to move to [orderswift](https://www.orderswift.com/), a small startup working in online food ordering. It was a change of industry and a massive change of pace and responsibility, doing everything from web development to hardware installation and customer service. I stayed for a year, but probably learnt about five years’ worth in the time!

I was looking for something a little different at this point, and happened to come across the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service). I liked the organisation, their work and their ways of working, so when the opportunity arose, I said yes with little hesitation. I spent three years working on various parts of [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/), and in that time moved up to eventually become Lead Developer. I also, for the first time, carried out and led interviews and became a line manager. I had an [Instagram story](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/03/how-we-use-instagram-at-gds/) made about my work and blogged about the [meaning of responsible building](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2017/07/24/what-do-we-mean-by-responsible-building/). The work gave me a real sense of purpose and I loved every moment of it.

In 2019, having decided to move from London to Cornwall with my wife, and remote working still being something that wasn’t universally accepted, I left GDS and London, and started work at [Resolver](https://www.resolvergroup.com/) as a Lead Developer, mostly remote but with three days a month in the office in London. I used to travel by train or plane and stay with my parents, but COVID-19 put an end to this regular commute. I worked on Accord ODR, a new SaaS app aimed at dispute resolution providers. In addition, my wife and I took on the project management of our own self-build house from 2020.

In April 2021, I moved to [Hopin](https://hopin.com/), where I worked as a Senior Backend Engineer, initially working on customer-facing analytics and latterly on experimental features for product growth. In May 2021, we moved to our newly built house, and we bought our first puppy, Saffy, a Portuguese Water Dog in July 2021.

In November 2022, along with a lot of others, I was made redundant from Hopin, and in December 2022, our daughter Evie was born. I took some involuntary time off to look after her for a few weeks.

In January 2023, after long having wanted to do so, I made the move to contract work, and worked for the [Office for Product Safety and Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-product-safety-and-standards) (OPSS) until April 2024. I then worked for [Indeed Flex](https://indeedflex.co.uk) for a little while before returning to OPSS in March 2025. I spend my non-work time helping look after my daughter and dog, as well as dabbling in various technical side-activities such as smart home automation and retro computing.
