In the spirit of Marcus Herrmann’s [Making RSS more visible again with a /feeds page](https://marcus.io/blog/making-rss-more-visible-again-with-slash-feeds), you can use any of the following feeds to subscribe to my blog using your favourite feed reader (mine’s [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com)).

* [RSS feed](/blog/rss.xml)
* [Atom feed](/blog/atom.xml)
* [JSON feed](/blog/feed.json)

For my essays, you can use the following feeds.

* [RSS feed (Essays)](/essays/rss.xml)
* [Atom feed (Essays)](/essays/atom.xml)
* [JSON feed (Essays)](/essays/feed.json)

All these feeds include all blog posts or essays and are tagged on every page of this website, so you should just be able to subscribe by pointing your feed reader to the homepage.
