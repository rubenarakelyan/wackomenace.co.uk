I’ve started getting more into podcasts to listen to while working instead of music. Here’s what I’m enjoying at the moment.

* [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm)
* [Rework](https://37signals.com/podcast/)
* [Scott & Mark Learn To...](https://shows.acast.com/scott-and-mark-learn-to)

All these podcasts are also available as an [OPML file](/podroll/rubenarakelyan.opml) to import into your favourite podcasts app.
