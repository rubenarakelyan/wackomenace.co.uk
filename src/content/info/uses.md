My primary driver for business and pleasure is a 2022 M2 MacBook Air expanded with 16GB RAM paired with an Apple Magic Keyboard and Mouse. It more than adequately handles anything I throw at it development-wise. My phone is an iPhone 14.

For software and services, I use many of the built-in Apple apps like Safari and Mail mostly because they Just Workâ„¢ and integrate well together. Apart from those, my main daily apps are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) and [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com).
