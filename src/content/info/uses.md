My primary driver for business and pleasure is a 2022 MacBook Air expanded with 16GB RAM. It more than adequately handles anything I throw at it development-wise. I also have a 5th generation iPad Air for when I don’t want/need a laptop.

My phone is an iPhone 14.

Yes, I am heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem. Yes, it works well most of the time. Yes, iCloud is years behind its rivals.

Software-wise, I use many of the built-in Apple apps like Safari and Mail mostly because they Just Work™. Apart from those, my main daily apps are [1Password](https://1password.com), [Nova](https://nova.app) and [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com).

## Recommendations

It’s becoming more and more difficult to companies that do a truly great job and are proud of their quality. Here are some I use that I can heartily recommend to others (with a UK bias).

### Andrews & Arnold (A&A)

<https://www.aa.net.uk>

A&A are a small UK-based ISP offering a variety of Internet access products with no filtering, but most importantly of all, common sense, genuinely knowledgeable customer service, and no reason to ever call them. Slightly more expensive that the major providers but you get what you pay for, and I pay for this without hesitation.

### Fastmail

<https://ref.fm/u26958808>*

I use Fastmail for both my personal and business email addresses and am very happy with the service. Lots of functionality, constant improvement and stronger privacy than the big, free players.

### Octopus Energy

<https://share.octopus.energy/sunny-bison-550>*

It’s normally difficult to get excited about an energy supplier, but Octopus Energy make it easier. They are more a technology company that happen to also supply electricity and gas. From their app which is head and shoulders above any other similar one, to their innovative tariffs and commitment to holding costs down, I don’t see why you’d want to go with anyone else.
