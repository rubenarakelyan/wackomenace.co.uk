My primary driver for business and pleasure is a 2022 M2 MacBook Air expanded with 16GB RAM paired with an Apple Magic Keyboard and Mouse. It more than adequately handles anything I throw at it development-wise. I also have a 5th generation iPad Air for when I don’t want/need a laptop.

My phone is an iPhone 14.

I have a Synology NAS which I keep all my files on, backed up to Backblaze and available via Synology Drive to my laptop and phone.

Software-wise, I use many of the built-in Apple apps like Safari and Mail mostly because they Just Work™. Apart from those, my main daily apps are [1Password](https://1password.com), [Nova](https://nova.app), [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com), [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) and [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com).
