My primary driver for business and pleasure is a 2022 M2 MacBook Air expanded with 16GB RAM paired with an Apple Magic Keyboard and Mouse. It more than adequately handles anything I throw at it development-wise. I also have a 5th generation iPad Air for when I don’t want/need a laptop.

My phone is an iPhone 14.

Yes, I am heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem. Yes, it works well most of the time. Yes, iCloud is years behind its rivals.

Software-wise, I use many of the built-in Apple apps like Safari and Mail mostly because they Just Work™. Apart from those, my main daily apps are [1Password](https://1password.com), [Nova](https://nova.app) and [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com).
