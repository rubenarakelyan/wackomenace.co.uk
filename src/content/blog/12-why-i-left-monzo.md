title: Why I left Monzo

excerpt: A darling startup grew up and forgot its roots.

I was one of the first people on the Monzo bandwagon when it first launched in 2015 and was still known as Mondo. My then boss was active in the startup scene and had heard they were seeking people who were open to alpha testing a bank! I eagerly joined up and even went to a couple of their in-person event in London to open my account, receive my first hot coral debit card and chat with other early adopters (plus I got the t-shirt!).

At the time, the established banks were all the same pile of rubbish - slow, uncaring and uninventive. Branches with long queues, poor websites running on some early 2000s Java runtime and thinly-skinned mobile app version of those same sites, which if they were bad on a desktop, were 10x more so on mobile. Monzo came at a time when no new bank had been licensed for **years**. It was a breath of fresh air, and what they stood for as well as what they wanted to achieve was unheard of in this most staid of industries.

Over the years, they innovated many new features that were promptly copied by the established banks (or their new hip offshoots like Mettle for NatWest). Gambling block? Copied. Card freeze and unfreeze? Copied. Instant transaction notifications? Copied. Cheque paying in via photo? Copied. One by one, the banks picked at Monzo’s best pieces and made them their own, at the same time as Monzo was trying to catch up with them by launching joint accounts, currency transfers, business accounts, savings accounts and loans amongst other things that are normally taken for granted.

Suffice to say, the one thing that Monzo held over and above the other banks was the impressive customer service. The in-app chat was prompt and helpful, solving issues that would have taken other banks hours on the phone, or horror of horrors, a visit to the local branch.

This customer service, however, has declined over the years to such an extent that it has become a poor parody of what it used to be.

It started when my wife, who I had persuaded to open a Monzo business account, suddenly had that account closed without any warning or reason. It was a notification of a failed direct debit for a bill payment that first alerted her to a potential issue. Surely it was some kind of error? She tried to contact them via the only possible route they’ve left open - the in-app chat (try phoning them, and play a game of choosing the correct combination of options from the four nested levels of choices to actually get through to a human rather than an automated message followed by hanging up).

At first, they pretended that they had warned her via an in-app notification (that never arrived). Then they said they couldn’t tell her why her account had been closed, and that it couldn’t be re-opened. At this point, with other bill payments looming, she opened another account with Mettle and asked them to at least transfer the money to the new account. Then she was ghosted for a couple of weeks despite multiple messages and automated confirmations.

It was only after she threatened going to the Financial Ombudsman that someone possibly more senior joined the chat, admitted that the closure was in error, and reinstated the account. At this point, with all trust having vanished, she quickly transferred the majority of the money to the new Mettle account and spent a lot of time changing direct debits, standing orders and card numbers with various companies. She did actually end up referring to the Ombudsman after they started ghosting her requests for compensation. And it’s a good thing she moved away, since a few weeks ago they came back again (this time with notice) to say that her account was being closed again, and again for a secret reason.

At this point, we decided that enough was enough. She emptied whatever was left and closed the account herself. Having seen all of this unfold, I had also had enough, and proceeded to close my personal and joint accounts as well as my business account with them. I’m not saying that other banks are angels compared to this, but we expected a lot more from Monzo, and were left sorely disappointed. In the process, they lost two very long-standing and loyal customers as well as five separate bank accounts.

Shame, but you need to vote with your money, and that’s exactly what we did.
