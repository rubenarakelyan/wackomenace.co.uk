> Update (10/12/2024): I’ve been informed by a reader that it’s no longer possible to use this technique to create new @msn.com addresses. It seems that this is a known issue and there are no plans to change it back, so for now, the rest of this post is just historic information.

There are many things that I would have not got rid of if I had the chance again - for example, my first and second PCs or all those CDs and floppy disks, but those are well and truly gone. Another thing is my first MSN email address. I got rid of it years ago when I was moving on to email addresses on custom domains, and again, it was a mistake now that everything old is new again.

Now, you haven’t been able to get a new MSN email address for many years, along with a live.com one (or even passport.com, you lucky people still with one). At least, that’s what I thought. If, like a normal person, you visit Microsoft Account and sign up, you get a choice of hotmail.com or outlook.com, all very pedestrian and common. I wanted that old school vibe with msn.com.

As it turns out, there is still a way to get a brand new msn.com email address, but not how you’d expect. There are a number of forum posts and tutorials advocating various tricks including intercepting requests with a proxy and buying dollar-denominated Xbox gift cards, but you don’t need anything so elaborate. Instead, we’ll make use of Microsoft’s penchant for keeping abandoned websites online much like historic artefacts. This works in the UK and I imagine it will also work in the USA and anywhere else that supports the Microsoft Store.

The trick is to use a subscription to MSN Premium, a service that should have died out years ago but is still inexplicably both online and available for new subscriptions, with a range of benefits that can mostly be replicated by free software or services. To sign up, simply visit <https://get.msn.com> and click the “Get it now” button at the top. This will lead you to the Microsoft Store page for the subscription. From here, choose the monthly subscription (£6.99 per month as of writing) and proceed to subscribe in the usual way. You can use any Microsoft Account at this stage.

Once you’ve subscribed, visit the [MSN Member Centre](https://membercenter.msn.com), sign in with the Microsoft Account you used above, and proceed to the management page. From here, you can add a number of extra accounts that can share your subscription. Use this feature to create new accounts for yourself, choosing your msn.com email address for each one. This will in fact create fully-fledged Microsoft Accounts with the msn.com email address as the primary.

Once you’re done, you can visit the [Microsoft Account site](https://account.microsoft.com) and end your subscription. I did this on the same day and was able to request a full refund which arrived the next day.

I didn’t find a way to add these msn.com email addresses as aliases for an existing Microsoft Account, but with email forwarding, this isn’t really an issue. As a full Microsoft Account, you can use outlook.com with these email addresses just like any hotmail.com or outlook.com email address.

Using this method, I’m now the proud owner of a couple of msn.com email addresses that I’ll keep for my future retro projects.
