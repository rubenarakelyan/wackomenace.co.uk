excerpt: I wrote a piece a few months ago about Richard Stallman. In light of the Stallman Report, I revisit it with fresh eyes.

A few months ago, I wrote a post, [Richard Stallman as a figurehead, or, knowing when you’re not the right person for the job](/blog/4-rms-as-a-figurehead/). In that post, I wrote about how in my view, Stallman has achieved a lot of good but is poor at articulating what he stands for in a way that is immediately understandable to the lay person.

On 14th October, the [Stallman Report](https://stallman-report.org) was released and made for grim reading. The authors have clearly spent a long time and a lot of effort documenting with as much evidence as possible his large-scale and longstanding misconduct. While a lot of people were somewhat aware that Stallman can be an unsavoury character (me included), this report laid bare a lot of stuff that had been happening out of sight.

Given this new information, I thought it would be important for me to go back and read what I wrote, and see what I would change or write differently given this new information.

That post mainly spoke to the impenetrability of Stallman’s missives and how it was a disservice to the movement he started many years ago but which has grown to be much larger than one person. In retrospect, that was just one piece of the puzzle, and I concentrated too much on that point without going into more detail on his misconduct as known at the time.

I also drew my line down the middle between Stallman’s supporters and critics. Again, in retrospect, that was the wrong place to draw the line. It is clear that the previous accusations were only the tip of a much larger iceberg that has now been revealed.

So with all that considered, I think that while it is right to leave the post as it was as a snapshot of my thoughts at the time and with full transparency, it is as important to clarify that my views have changed since then. I am now aware of a lot more than I was back then, and I think my previous conclusion about Stallman stepping down still stands but for different reasons: it is clear he is a persistent offender with both no remorse and no insight into the effects of his actions. For the good of both the community and his numerous victims, he needs to step down from all his roles with immediate effect, issue clear and full apologies for his actions and behaviour, and retire himself from public life.
