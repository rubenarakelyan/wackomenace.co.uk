excerpt: There are some industries that are just too devoid of a social conscience to work in.

I started my career at Shell - that’s a fact, however inconvenient. Back in 2010, although climate change was of course being talked about and companies having a conscience was also a known topic, it was nowhere near as advanced as it now is. Of course, we had the occasional Greenpeace protest outside the office and a few of my more activist friends would raise an eyebrow at my employer of choice, but by and large, it was a given that some people worked in this place and for most, it was just a career, not a lifestyle or political choice. Anyway, time went by and I eventually left, mostly due to the glacial pace of career advancement, and thought nothing more of it.

However, in the last few years, the chorus of voices calling for ethical business practices, real climate-friendly policies rather than greenwashed corporate ESR and boycotts of large, polluting and exploitative industries have prompted me to have a deeper think about the kind of company or industry I want to be associated with in my future career. Working for an oil major straight out of university is no longer the decision I’d make in the same position, and so I want to make sure I make the right decisions for myself in the future.

Part of that involves determining which companies and industries don’t sit well with me and which I consider unethical. So, here’s a list of industries I have decided not to work in:

* Defence and weapons
* Extractive (oil, gas and mining)
* Gambling
* Pornography
* Tobacco

There may be ones I’ve missed out but those are the ones that immediately stand out to me. Some of this is to do with my Christian religion which wouldn’t look too kindly on working in pornography, for example, but a lot is also simply to do with the fact that all of those industries exploit people in one way or another and bring out their worst tendencies. And I just don’t want to be associated with that sort of behaviour.

Have you sat down and thought about where you wouldn’t want to work?
