excerpt: The sheer arrogance of some in the community puts off everyday users and potential converts.

I recently read Kev Quirk’s post [Linux Elitism...again](https://kevquirk.com/linux-elitism-again), which normally would have had me shaking my head at the sheer arrogance of the participants, but instead, it merely confirmed something I’ve been seeing for years.

I recently wrote about [Richard Stallman as a figurehead](/blog/4-rms-as-a-figurehead/) and how in my opinion, his sheer intransigence and arrogance puts off a lot of people who would otherwise be fully in the Linux camp. What I forgot to mention, however, is that he is far from the only person in the community who exhibits these traits.

Kev wrote about the vitriol that [Ruben Schade](https://rubenerd.com/) received when he posted what should be a common-sense and uncontroversial remark about some people needing to use Windows, and how that doesn’t mean they’ve relinquished their right to complain about its issues and limitations. Almost immediately, the crowd pounced, denouncing this viewpoint and asserting that anyone using Windows deserves what they get and they should either shut up or migrate to Linux.

There are a lot of people who put up with suboptimal conditions, products or services for many reasons. Maybe their work means they don’t have a choice. Maybe they don’t know about the alternatives, or don’t feel comfortable, confident or productive using them. Maybe it’s all they can afford. None of this means they can’t complain about their situation or want improvement.

Frankly, I find this behaviour disgusting, but it seems to find a home of sorts in the community. Of course, I’m not saying that everyone in the community is like this, or even the majority of people, or that there aren’t other communities with a similar problem, but the deeper you go, the more likely it is you’ll find someone like this. Some label them zealots, but I think they are simply bad humans. The attributes that mean they fight tooth and nail for seemingly banal semantics also generally makes them a pain-in-the-arse to work with or be on the receiving end of.

If Linux is to ever become a mainstream operating system that non-technical people may be expected to use and crucially, **want** to use, these kinds of attitudes need to be stamped out, and the perpetrators need to stop, frankly, being dicks and try to embody even a modicum of empathy for the majority of computers users who just want to do their work. I’m no Microsoft apologist, but it’s exactly these attitudes that make me reticent to recommend Linux as a desktop operating system to most people who cannot and will not put up with this.

So my message to the people behind this is simple - if you want your ultimate dream of Linux desktop dominance to have a chance of happening, you either need to take a long, hard look at yourself, or simply learn to keep your mouth shut every time you feel yourself wanting to “correct someone on the Internet”.
