excerpt: How I started off on my lifelong computing journey.

Inspired by Robb Knight’s [computing origin story](https://rknight.me/blog/my-computing-origin-story/), here’s **roughly** how my computing history goes. A lot of the dates are **very** approximate since I don’t have many photos or records of what I’ve owned over the years.

## VTech notebook

The very first “computer” I had, given to me as a Christmas present, when they were better known for these “computers” rather than security-nightmare IoT products. The most interesting part (for me) was the built-in BASIC interpreter, which was my first exposure to programming and probably set me up for life. This is what I used to write my [number game](https://github.com/rubenarakelyan/numbergame) that I used to play with my brothers.

## Hardcard computer

A generic PC clone my dad found in a charity shop and bought for £10. It ran some unknown text-based operating system and had a pleasingly-technical-looking amber CRT monitor. Unfortunately, it broke not too long after purchase, and my repair chops weren’t enough at the time to fix it. I did open it, however, and noticed it sported a “hardcard” - a hard drive mounted on a daughterboard which I thought was mildly interesting and amusing.

## Packard Bell PC

My first proper PC, and the first one my parents bought at full price (paying by instalments!) for the family. It came with a box of floppy disks (most of which lay unused for years), a bunch of built-in software (some of which I documented in [My first PC](/blog/2-my-first-pc/)) and *freeserve* dial-up internet (which we eventually upgraded to Blueyonder broadband, which became Telewest and then Virgin Media). I have many fond memories of this PC, including upgrading the operating system, hardware and the multiple breakages. My dad also used this for his video recording work and over time I added capture cards, TV tuners, DV input and more to it.

## RM PCs from school

My secondary school had the usual RM desktops in the IT rooms, and when they were due for a refresh, I managed to persuade the IT team to allow us to take (officially rent indefinitely for no consideration) two for home. My brothers each got one in their bedroom so we didn’t all have to compete for the family PC. They were real workhorses and were only retired once we got something better.

## Advent PC

Once the Packard Bell PC was showing its age, it was relegated to secondary status and my parents bought their second full-price PC - an Advent (PC World own-brand) tower PC with another monster CRT monitor. It served as the main family PC for a number of years. I replaced it with a custom build PC around the time I moved out and my brothers got their own laptops.

## iBook

When I went to university, I wanted a laptop I could carry around campus and to lectures, so I bought myself a second-hand PowerPC-era iBook Mac laptop from eBay. It was my first foray into the Mac ecosystem so I had some learning to do, but I ended up liking it a lot and it probably started off my slow move to an entirely Apple-based setup.

## Custom PC

Having a Mac laptop didn’t stop my desire to build something again for myself, so I got some parts from eBuyer and built a nicely-specced tower PC which I used at university alongside my iBook. I eventually sold it when I decided to move to an all-Mac setup.

## iMac

I had longed for an iMac for a long time, and I finally decided to go for one when I found a reasonably-priced second-hand aluminium iMac on eBay. I even took a train to collect it in person (it was heavy!). Around the time I was finishing university, I sold both the iMac and iBook and went to my next system.

## Custom PC

My third custom build PC came when I left university to start work. This became my daily driver until I started working remotely and received various models of Mac laptops.
