Over the past few months, I have been working behind-the-scenes on a little project, and it’s now ready to reveal: [Safran](https://www.safran.agency), my new web and mobile app agency, working with the [Bayspace Platform](https://bayspace-stives.com/bayspace-platform/) and [Barclays Eagle Labs](https://labs.uk.barclays/about).

I started Safran because I see a lot of small and medium-sized businesses that could really propel their growth with web and mobile apps, built to their needs and within their budgets, but who are put off by large, corporate agencies and their corresponding large fees.

If you’re in the market for a web or mobile app or know someone who is, and you’d like to support a small local business, please [get in touch](https://www.safran.agency/contact/). If you’d like to discuss a project, you can also [schedule a free, no obligation 25 minute initial consultation](https://cal.com/safran) to go through the details and ask any questions you have about the process.
