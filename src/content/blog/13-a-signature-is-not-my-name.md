Over the last few years, as I have had the opportunity to sign more and more official documents (buying a house, getting a mortgage etc), I have come across a number of companies that seem to believe for no good reason that a signature must resemble the name of its owner.

No matter how many times I tried to explain that a signature doesn’t even have to be **a** name, let alone **my** name, they keep insisting. In effect, insisting that I sign their super-duper important legal document with a false signature that just happens to be a legible version of my name. Cutting off their nose to spite their face, so to speak.

Until now, I’ve only had my own opinion and that of some websites that are definitely **not** experts on the subject as proof, so after the latest bout, I decided to do something about it.

I tooted into the fediverse to see if anyone could provide me with a legal opinion that backed up my opinion, tagging in [Neil Brown](https://decoded.legal), a UK-based solicitor with a tech specialism who is active on Mastodon.

Barely a few minutes later, Neil was kind enough to reply with a couple of footnotes from an academic law website (!) that seem to provide what I was looking for:

> In *Morton v. Copeland* Maule J stated that signing:
>
> “does not necessarily mean writing a person’s Christian and surname, but any mark which identifies it as the act of the party.”
>
> &mdash; <cite>[Journal of Information Law & Technology](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2000_3/reed/footnotes#fnb48)</cite>

There we go. Amusingly, this is from a judgment in 1855! But no matter, the principle remains. Next time someone erroneously states that a signature needs to match your name, feel free to refer them to *Morton v. Copeland* (1855) 16 CB 517, 535. That should make them think!
