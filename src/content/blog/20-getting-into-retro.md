excerpt: As I get older, I’m inevitably longing for the tech trappings of my youth.

When I was younger (as most good stories start), I couldn’t wait to be older. Technology was moving on at such a pace that I felt right in the middle of a massive upheaval, seeing my parents and their generation as mere luddites compared to my high-tech, fast-paced upbringing. I readily got rid of old tech as soon as something newer came along - computers, software boxes, mobile phones, music players, cameras and more. Holding on to old stuff was a waste of time - it was all about the future.

And now? 20 or so years later, I have come to realise what I’ve done and regret getting rid of all that. As retro tech becomes cool again (and not just with the old timers), I find myself longing for the tech of my youth - all the things mentioned above but also the manuals, certificates and more than catalogued my tech journey to date. All of that is still fresh in my mind but I no longer have anything physical to show for it or even demonstrate to my daughter when she is old enough to understand (and hopefully care!).

I would love to fire up the first computer I had, get that Windows 98 sound again, and play some of the old games that came with it. Yes, I can do this with a virtual machine (and I did this in [my first PC](/blog/2-my-first-pc/)) or even a similar vintage machine I find on eBay but it’s just not the same.

I guess this is a friendly warning of sorts for my future self as well as others earlier in their tech journey who haven’t yet got to that point - don’t do it. The future doesn’t always get better, and you may not think it now, but you’ll get to a point where you’ll hanker for the tech of years past. I know I do, and not to have any of it makes me a little sad.
