excerpt: I got my first piece of guestbook spam less than a day after making it live.

It was only yesterday that I wrote about [Building a guestbook with Astro and Cloudflare Pages](/blog/5-building-a-guestbook-with-astro-and-cloudflare-pages/) and made it live, and I already have my first piece of guestbook spam!

There it is, in all its pill-peddling glory. Thanks my the mandatory moderation, however, this fine piece of prose never made it onto the actual guestbook. Now it can just fester for a while in the database until it is unceremoniously deleted!
