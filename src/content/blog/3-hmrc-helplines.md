**tl;dr** HMRC, nobody actually wants to call you and stay on the line for more than an hour to resolve an issue. They just have to because you give them no option to do what they need to online.

Yesterday, I read an [FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/2ba64769-0760-4ddb-b134-b586723d0c19) about the latest gambit by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to reduce any potential contact with their customers (i.e. taxpayers). I think this sentence says everything you need to know about how much HMRC is aware of the capabilities of their own online services:

> […] scaling back the helplines would encourage taxpayers to manage their affairs, or “self-serve”, online […]

I run my own business and have to deal with HMRC quite a lot for PAYE, VAT and Corporation Tax. Mostly, FreeAgent (my accounting software of choice) hides the complexity of calculating and reporting tax liabilities, and I have set up Direct Debits for each of those taxes to make sure they’re paid on time. All this means that normally I don’t have to talk with them at all. But when I do, it’s normally because of some exceptional circumstance that needs a human to look at it, and it isn’t possible to deal with it online.

Let me give an example.

A month or so ago, I missed a deadline to file my quarterly VAT return. While I could go on about how FreeAgent should have made this serious situation more obvious to me than it did, at the end of the day, I messed up. My bad. So of course, as soon as I found out about this, I filed it. I then went to the HMRC website to check about paying what I owed. I already have a Direct Debit set up to pay quarterly VAT as it becomes due from my business bank account. When I logged in, I noticed that the website said that I was late with payment, which makes sense as I filed late. However, it also made it sound like the Direct Debit would not work in this situation to take the payment, and that I needed to pay manually.

OK, so the website says I need to pay, and they’ll charge interest for every day I don’t. I don’t trust that the Direct Debit will take payment, or that it won’t wait to do so, therefore increasing the penalty interest. So I clicked the link under the due amount to make a manual payment. Using the wonders of Open Banking, I gave one-time permission to debit the amount from my account immediately and thought that was the end of the matter. The website always takes time to realise that you’ve paid (how come they can take payment immediately but you have to wait 48 hours for it to reflect on the website?) but that’s par for the course with government services, so I created a calendar reminder to check and left it at that.

A day or so later, I received an email from HMRC informing me that the Direct Debit for my VAT was going to be paid in the next two days to the tune of the exact amount I’d already manually paid to clear the debt. Confused, I logged in to the HMRC website to check the outstanding amount. The Direct Debit was showing, alongside the payment I’d already made. However, my payment was attributed as an “unallocated payment”. In other words, HMRC think I just paid them a random amount out of the kindness of my heart, and didn’t think that an amount I’d paid that matched exactly what I owed via a link dedicated to paying that amount for that purpose might just be attributed as a VAT payment. So the Direct Debit was paid, resulting in me paying the same amount twice.

There is no way of resolving this situation online. Firstly, it shouldn’t even happen since they know why I paid. Secondly, even if it does happen, the system should allow you to define what the payment was for manually, or request a refund. But no, once you’re in this situation, the only option is to phone HMRC, using the same helplines they propose to close to encourage “self-serve”.

After nearly an hour listening to the same 10 seconds of hold music on repeat, the most disinterested agent I’ve ever spoken to came on the line. After some security questions and checking my account, he said that he’d need to fill out and submit a form to assign my manual payment to the correct service. Where do I start? Why does this not happen automatically? Or why isn’t this a one-click button? Why can’t I click it? And why does it take 10 working days? So many questions, no answers.

He also said that he couldn’t stop the upcoming Direct Debit, but that I could have the pleasure (my words, not his) of calling back to ask for a refund if I wanted it. Suffice to say, they probably wish they hadn’t asked me for a follow-up survey after that call. Not that any of my answers will make any difference at all.

All this to say, when HMRC says they want to encourage “self-serve”, the way to achieve that isn’t to close down all avenues of contact and then pat themselves on the back for lower call volumes. Maybe they should invest the time spent coming up with that plan on improving their online services to actually allow taxpayers to “self-serve” in the first place.
