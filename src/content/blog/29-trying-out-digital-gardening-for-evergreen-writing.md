title: Trying out digital gardening for evergreen writing

excerpt: I want to test out how a digital garden might work for me.

Recently, I have been reading about digital gardens and looking around a few people’s gardens to see how they do it.

I like the idea of a place on my site that isn’t a blog, but dedicated to writing that has longer-term relevance and which I may update from time-to-time. That’s not to say I want to get rid of my blog entirely - I think there’s still space for point-in-time writing, like things I’ve done or learnt.

However, I have a number of ideas for things I’d like to write about that are longer form and will take multiple sessions and rounds to write, hone, correct and update. They have longer-term relevance (at least to me) and will be the kind of thing I’d sit down to read with a tea if I was browing someone else’s website.

So I’m going to try it out for a bit. It’s pretty low-effort to set up but hopefully it’ll be a useful companion to the blog.
