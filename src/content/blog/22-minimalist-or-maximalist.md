excerpt: I tend to switch between the two but can’t seem to settle on either.

Jose Gilgado wrote about [simplicity and ornateness](https://josem.co/simple-to-ornate-and-back-again/) and how at least architecture tends to flip-flop between the two styles in cycles. It resonated with me not because I’m any sort of architecture buff, but instead because I instantly recognised the pattern as the way my mind seems to work. Throughout my working life, I’ve gone through cycles.

At one point in the cycle, I am maximalist - I take on a number of extra opportunities, both at work and outside, I start new hobbies, try my hand at a side-gig and generally fill up my time and headspace with activity. At this point, I feel fresh, motivated and able to take on the world. I have visions of where I could get to if only I did this-or-that thing and I plan for getting there.

At the other point of the cycle, I am minimalist - the extra opportunities come back to haunt me with extra responsibility, deadlines and people to please. The hobbies become mundane and lose their initial shine. I don’t feel like I have any time for myself to vegetate. My side-gig hasn’t got anywhere and I generally feel deflated and defeated. I start shedding responsibility like a snake sheds its skin. I shut things down, stop hobbies and get rid of things.

I don’t know if anyone else recognises this pattern but I’ve gone through a number of these cycles so far and have started to recognise it. Right now, I feel like I am on the way down from the maximalist phase heading towards minimalist. This time, however, I am trying to dampen the stark difference between the two and mapping a course that, while it doesn’t aim to completely eradicate these cycles (I don’t think I *can*), at least tries to find a middle ground that allows me to have a small number of important-to-me responsibilities and remain social whilst not taking on too much and burning out.

Do you recognise this in yourself? How do you deal with it? Please let me know.
