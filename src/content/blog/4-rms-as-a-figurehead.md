title: Richard Stallman as a figurehead, or, knowing when you’re not the right person for the job

excerpt: Richard Stallman has admirable grit and has achieved more than a lot of other people, but he is not the right person to be the public face of the software freedom movement.

I happened to stumble upon Martin Tournoij’s excellent blog post [Stallman isn’t great, but not the devil](https://www.arp242.net/rms.html) recently and found myself agreeing vigorously with most of the points he makes. It re-reminded me of the great hoo-ha of Richard Stallman’s ouster from and re-admittance to the Free Software Foundation that I watched unfold from afar.

A lot of accusations and counter-accusations were thrown around during those turbulent times, but I think neither side made their argument persuasive enough. Of course the staunch Stallman apologists insisted he had done nothing wrong and had been maliciously targeted and misinterpreted, while the staunch Stallman detractors countered that he had history with such matters and had to go, permanently.

I think the real story is somewhere in the middle, but that the conclusion must be that on balance, he is not the right person to be such a public figurehead not only of a non-profit organisation, but an entire global movement that he terms “free software”.

***

If you read Stallman’s history, he has achieved a great deal in his life so far. It is debatable whether the “free software” movement would ever have happened without him, or whether we’d be in some alternative history where the principal competitor to Microsoft Windows was some other proprietary platform based on Lisp. I hope most people can at least agree that he has achieved a net positive in terms of contribution to the world.

He is also, however, thoroughly unsuitable for the role he has found himself in due to this work.

The problem with Richard Stallman, so to speak, is that he is a pedant of the highest order. Now, most tech geeks (me included) are somewhere to the right of the non-tech population on the pedantry spectrum. I think it comes from the line of work - programming is inherently a precision endeavour that is very sensitive to the slightest error. This trait inherently leaks somewhat into daily life and interactions with non-tech geeks. Stallman, however, is on another scale altogether.

One only needs to read one article, essay or even mailing list reply from him to come out the other side completely bamboozled by the thought process and excessive linguistic acrobatics that he employs every time he reaches for his pen or keyboard.

Let’s take an example:

> I think it is ok for authors (please let’s not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let’s not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages).

This comes from an archived version of his Wikipedia entry. Can you tell on first reading exactly what he’s attempting to say? Let’s make it easier by cutting out the linguistic crusades:

> I think it is ok for authors to ask for money for copies of their works in order to gain income.

He’s actually making an important point here against the frequent accusation that he thinks all software should be free-of-charge and that nobody is allowed an income or to make a living from software. However, all that nuance gets lost in multiple pointless diversions into the merits (or not) of specific terminology.

This is not limited to email replies. He will refuse to grant interviews or talks unless journalists and organisers agree with his personal allow-list of terms (which include terms such as GNU/Linux or digital restrictions management).

I can see his point-of-view. He’s been burned and misrepresented on his views for probably most of his life, and he’s had enough. The same with the now-famous (or maybe infamous) rider which is sent to anyone who wants to arrange for him to speak at their event. Plenty of sane points that attempt to make the professional nomad’s travelling life somewhat easier are lost within reams of polemics on exactly what to say and not to say to him.

For me or you, individual contributors in our small worlds, this wouldn’t matter. Either nobody would notice or we’d just be chalked up as weird and everyone would move on. But when you’re probably the single best-known person at the top of a global movement for free and open source software, words and presentation matters. Clarity is key. He is spearheading a crusade against proprietary closed-source software, global monopolies, bad practice and bad-faith breaches of personal rights. People need to know exactly what he stands for and how they can help. You could excuse most people after hearing Stallman or reading his writings for being thoroughly put-off from the entire community. That is exactly the opposite of what he is trying to achieve.

What the community needs is the ethics of Stallman combined with the marketing of Apple. He is not the person who can provide this, and the sooner he realises this and moves himself into a more suitable role, the sooner someone more adept at clearly espousing the merits of software freedom can take over and begin to heal the rifts and bring the various tents together. Only when the entire community is speaking as one can there begin to be serious understanding in the non-tech community about what the software freedom movement is and why it’s imperative that it succeeds.
