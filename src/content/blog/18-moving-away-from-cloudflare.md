excerpt: Why I’m moving away from Cloudflare to smaller providers.

Domain names (along with hosting) are one of those perpetual projects for me. No matter which company I decide to go with, a little later I’m back to square one, looking at alternatives.

For a little while, this site (and others) plus my domain names have been with Cloudflare. I originally picked them since they offered a lot of services for free and seemed large enough to not simply disappear overnight and take everything down.

However, over time I’ve come to realise that the best service is not always from these larger companies, although in theory they are able to throw many more people at a problem. It is instead from the smaller, local companies that offer a smaller set of features, a lot of the time for a higher price, but pride themselves on their customer service, quality and community engagement.

This has been my experience with [A&A](https://www.aa.net.uk) (which I’d recommend to anyone) as an ISP and I wanted the same sort of setup for domains and hosting. Although A&A do support both, it is not their main business and the offerings are rudimentary. I had heard of [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com) from various sources over the years, but they really came into their own on Mastodon, where one can see them engaging with the community (and likewise with A&A) so I decided to bite the bullet and move across.

Domains and hosting are more expensive than Cloudflare (who sell domains at cost and provide a lot of free hosting, both as loss leaders) but the support is what I expected and so I’m happy to pay the extra. In addition, they offer services like secondary DNS and fallback MX that you don’t always get elsewhere, and those are very reasonably priced (or free in many circumstances).

As part of this move, I also [transitioned my sites to static](/blog/16-dynamic-to-static/) and, along with the shared hosting I use from Mythic Beasts, the simplicity is so refreshing.

The lesson here is - next time you’re looking at a service from one of the big players, have a little think about whether a smaller, more local company could offer something similar with the personal touch. This is how I’ll be looking at services in the future.
