title: Increasing voter turnout

excerpt: Turnout in UK elections is lower than it should be, but it doesn’t have to be that way.

**NOTE:** Some concepts have been simplified to keep this post readable. For example, I use “polling station” to mean both “polling place” (the building) and “polling station” (the individual booth in the building) because most people don’t differentiate between the two.

A few days ago, the UK held a general election. Turnout was 60%[^1], which is the second lowest since 1885. This means that 40% of the eligible population did not vote, which is a shameful statistic.

It doesn’t have to be that way.

Some people say that we just have to accept that as younger people are less interested in political participation and voting, then over time turnout is bound to decrease and nothing can be done about it. These are the same people who blame the younger generations for many current social ills, and if only they voted more and bought fewer smashed avocado toasts, the world would be a better place.

I disagree.

While voter apathy does anecdotally seem to increase in younger generations, there are still plenty of people who are politically active and want to make a change. In addition, we must ask ourselves - why have the politically inactive made that choice? Is it because they really could not care less about who governs the country, what they do and what happens as a result? Or is it that they feel disenfranchised by either the current state of politics, the voting process, or both?

Politics as a whole of course can do much better. The very setup of Parliament encourages face-to-face verbal combat where each side attempts to score cheap political points against their counterpart, which makes for sometimes entertaining but mostly debased viewing. That is a whole separate and very large discussion point for another day. Here, I want to concentrate on what concrete steps can be taken regarding the voting process itself to make it more likely that people will turn out.

Fans of the Australian systems will say - easy, just make it compulsory. Of course, this will increase turnout to maybe 99%, but it is simply papering over the cracks and will do nothing to address the underlying issues that manifest as low turnout. It also means that people with genuinely no political views will have to vote, which I think is wrong. If you genuinely don’t care, then I think it’s right that you **don’t vote**, therefore allowing the votes of others to count for more.

With all that said, here are my ideas for how turnout can be increased for future elections - both general and local, most with little or no spending required.

## Move polling day to the weekend

As per convention, polling day is always a Thursday. This makes no sense. It is a working day, where the majority of the eligible population will be at a place of work. They would have to either take time off, or maybe their lunch break, to visit their designated polling station. There are no allowances made for this - there is no public holiday or paid time allocated to carrying out probably the most important civic duty most people will do, unlike jury duty, which is protected.

Moving polling days to a Saturday, for example, is an easy way to encourage more people to turn up.

## Extend polling to the whole weekend

Why does polling day need to be only one day? Many other countries spread it out over a number of days, mainly large ones with dispersed populations, but it could also be done in the UK. By making both Saturday and Sunday polling days, people could keep one day for their own activities while still being able to take part. People who work at weekends would also have two opportunities.

## Make leaving work to vote allowed by default

Carrying out jury duty is an activity that your employer cannot deny you leaving work for unless very specific circumstances apply. By protecting voting in the same way (for example, by legislating to allow a 30 minute paid break for the purposes of voting), more people, especially those in high pressured manual working environments, will feel confident to leave to vote without being reprimanded.

## Allow voters to attend any polling station in their constituency

All registered voters are allocated a polling station that they need to attend to vote. Constituencies have multiple polling stations, so why not be able to attend whichever one is most convenient? For example, one on the route to a place of work or other engagement?

## Allow a polling card to be used as identification

For most of the UK’s history, no identification has been required to vote. The general election just gone was only the second one where photographic identification was required, and it’s not at all clear if it made any difference to apparent voter fraud, which was very low even before the requirement. With this background, a middle ground could be found by using polling cards as identification. After all, they are issued for free to all registered voters and contain all the relevant information.

## Automatically register the eligible population

Right now, people have to consciously register to exercise their right to vote. Many people miss out because they have forgotten to register by the deadline, or maybe moved recently. Using data from sources such as council tax, the electoral register could be greatly expanded to enfranchise this portion of the population.

## ...and many more?

This is just what I’ve come up with, and I’m sure there are other equally good or better ideas I’ve missed. I’d be very interested in hearing from you if you have any ideas.
