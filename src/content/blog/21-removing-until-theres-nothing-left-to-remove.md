When I first built the current incarnation of this website, I went with an unashamedly maximalist approach. I studied dozens of personal websites and blogs of people I admired on the web and took notes of everything they did, from the features to the colour schemes and resolved to copy everything I liked to my own site.

For a while, this worked well as it allowed me to bootstrap a website from scratch and have enough to not make it seem unfinished. While I kept an eye on things like load time, data transferred and the carbon footprint of the site, my primary concern was the feature-set.

A few months ago, in the name of simplification, I decided to move this site from [dynamic to static](/blog/16-dynamic-to-static/) to make it lighter weight and allow it to be hosted on shared web hosting. This was primarily about cost-saving and using more ethical companies and services, but it had the side-effect of somewhat reducing the overhead of all the features.

Fast-forward a few months and I’ve been thinking more and more about what I want this website to achieve, how much effort I put into it and whether I really need everything I built. After all, it may have been right for others, but is it right for me?

Taking a lot of inspiration from [Low-Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) and [Dries Buytaert](https://dri.es/my-solar-powered-and-self-hosted-website), I have decided to try to make this website as small and efficient as possible while keeping those features that are useful and dumping the rest. This will not only result in having to maintain less, but will also dramatically reduce the heft of the website overall, make it more efficient and environmentally-friendly. It may even allow me in future to host it on a solar-powered server!
