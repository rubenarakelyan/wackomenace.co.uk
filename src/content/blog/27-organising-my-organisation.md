excerpt: Moving all my to-dos to one place.
---

Like most people, I have to-dos. Whether those are house-related, work or in my personal life, there are lists and lists of things I need to get to one day. And like a lot of those people, I keep track of these to-dos in a variety of places.

## A list of where I keep lists

A few weeks ago, I decided to make a quick inventory of all the places where I kept lists of things to do. I went through my physical and digital places and made a list. It was a lot longer than I expected.

I managed to come up with the following:

* Calendar - I make whole-day events for things I need to do either on that day or at some point
* Notes - I have an unstructured note full of various to-dos in no particular order
* Reminders - some things with defined dates and recurrences are in Reminders
* Files - I have a To Do folder with tickets for upcoming events, documents awaiting reply and others
* Emails - my inbox is basically one giant to-do list
* Desk - my physical desk has books and magazines to read as well as some paperwork pending on others

That’s somewhat frightening and not at all sustainable.

I decided to do something about it.

## One list to rule them all

In the past, I have used Trello both for work and personally (for example, I tracked our house build on a Trello board).

Since it’s free and easy to use, I decided that Trello was going to be my one true list of to-dos.

I created a Trello board for to-dos. Then, I moved all my calendar events (apart from things I need to do today or on a given day) to the board.  I then proceeded to move all my notes and files (I created cards and added the files as attachments).

Finally, I moved my reminders to my calendar and created recurring events for them.

That got me a lot of the way there, but there’s also my emails. In true to-do fashion, I created a card in my new to-do board to do something about my inbox!

My new-found system is in no way complete, but I already feel much lighter knowing pretty-much everything is either in my calendar (short-term) or Trello (long-term).

Next to tackle my emails!
